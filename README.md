## Main Functionalities
- The gamification mechanic, with two indexes: "carbon efficiency" and "local contribution". 
- Let people store their urban farming effort on their account, and accumulate "carbon efficiency" over time.
- A special vegetable shop where users can request their desired vegetables types, and quantity, and local provider can resolve their requests, and a one-take vegetable shop, allowing ones to buy vegetables in adjacent local area with ease.
